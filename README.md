**TrafficManager** is a **FiveM** resource aiming to advance the way servers handle traffic management; providing access to toggle vehicle nodes, including other essentials such as speed zones and secure zones.

## Usage
**/trafficmenu** - Open or close the traffic menu.
**F5** - Default keybinding for the traffic menu. This can be changed per user in Settings -> Keybindings -> FiveM.

## Configuration
Configurations are defined within the fxmanifest.

## Permissions
This FORKED resource is ESX dependent.  Add jobs to the fxmanifest.lua.  Each additional job should be placed on its own line with a ```job``` key
